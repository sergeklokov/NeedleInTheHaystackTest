Coding exersise / interview test.

Find "needle in the hay".
Hay and needle represented by random strings. 
Example 1: "abcdefgh" and "abc".
However, you need to find needle "sequentially", means, that leters could be separated by other letters. 
Example 2: "abcdefgh" and "abf", noticed that between b and f there are other letters. 

======================
I used two versions of method:
1. normal with the for loop.
2. regex
